Announce a message from pull requests into Slack

### Motivation

I have forgotten to announce too many times at work. This workflow involved moving from a pull
request and writing out the message myself into a channel. This made me think *"shouldn't think be done entirely from a PR?"*.

By simply adding `announcement="<message>"` to a pull request, the given message should be placed into a channel.
